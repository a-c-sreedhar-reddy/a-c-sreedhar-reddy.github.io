          Tell the reducer what happened. Not what to update the state with.

        <p>
          Reducer is a function which takes the <b> current state </b> and an
          <b>action</b> as inputs and returns a new state as an output.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the logic to update state is colocated at a single place. This
          helps us in managing the state complexity. We can be sure that no
          other part of the code outside this function can update the state.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In general action should not be the new state which we want to set,
          but should be the event that has occured.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Consider we have a login flow with multiple modals. And clicking on
          next buttons opens a new modal.
        </p>
        <p>To manage this we might need a state of the following type</p>
        <code>
          <pre style="background-color: black">
type state = {
  modal: "login" | "signUp" | "joinTeam" | "invite";
  otherProperties: any;
};
	  </pre
          >
        </code>
        <p>
          Now the actions of this reducer should be "SignupSuccess" or
          "LoginSuccess" or "JoinedTeam" or "Invited" rather than a single
          "updateModal"
        </p>
        <p>
          If we just have a single action "updateModal" then we would not get
          much from using reducer pattern. since anyone at anypoint of time with
          any payload can call this action.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand if we have actions like "SignupSuccess" or
          "LoginSuccess" or "JoinedTeam" or "Invited", then we can generate new
          state based on the existing state and action.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in the future if we want to extend this application, then we can
          directly go to this reducer and change the part where we handle the
          corresponding action
        </p>
